Create the following table and insert 10 rows in the table:
. EMP (EMPNO , ENAME, JOB, MGR, HIREDATE, SAL, COMM, DEPT _NAME)
 EMPNO must be between 7000 and 8000
 ENAME must not exceed 10 characters
 MGR is managers EMPNO
 COMM (commission) must be under 1500 and defaults to O. Only who works as salesman
gets certain commission.
 DEPT _NAME is the name of the department in which the employees works.

Write necessary SQL queries with corresponding Outputs for the following:
Ans1. select * from emp where substr(ename, 2, 1) like 'i';

Ans2:SELECT * FROM EMP where JOB not like 'managers';

Ans3:SELECT MAX(SAL) AS MAXIMUM,MIN(SAL) AS MINIMUM,SUM(SAL) AS TOTAL,AVG(SAL) AS AVERAGE FROM EMP;

Ans4:select job, max(sal) as MAX, min(sal) as MIN, sum(sal) as Total, avg(sal) as Average from emp1 group by(job);

Ans5:SELECT COUNT(JOB) FROM EMP where job='managers';

Ans6:SELECT * FROM EMP where HIREDATE>='1980-01-01';

Ans7:select MAX(SAL) from emp where job='salesman';

ans8:select MIN(SAL) from emp where job='clerk';

ans9:select dept_name from emp where ename='Solly';

ans10:select dept_name FROM EMP where SAL=(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);

ans11:SELECT ENAME FROM EMP where  SAL>(SELECT SAL FROM EMP where ENAME='Allen');
