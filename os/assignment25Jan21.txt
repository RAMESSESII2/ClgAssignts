    An optimisation could include partitioning 2nd block in to 25k + 50k and 4th block in 100K+75K.

2.  Total possible locations = 2^22
    since 2 byte addresable, size of memory = 2*2^22 = 2^23 bytes.

3. Let x be the no. of bits required in the address.
    then 2^n*4 = 16GB = 2^34
        => 2^n = 2 ^ 32
        => n = 32 bits.
