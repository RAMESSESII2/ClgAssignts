1)  Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association.
Association:-
    1. It represents Has-A relationship.
    2. It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. For example, department can have students but vice versa is not       
       possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
    3. In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually    
        which means ending one entity will not effect the other entity
    4. Composition is a strong Association

Aggregation:-
    1. It represents part-of relationship.
    2. In composition, both the entities are dependent on each other.
    3. When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.
    4. Aggregation is a weak Association.

2)Yes, whenever an object is created constructor is called first, if a constructor is not defined then default       
    constructor is called.

3) Default Constructor:
    A constructor that has no parameter is known as default constructor. If we donâ€™t define a constructor in a class, then compiler creates default constructor(with no arguments) for the class. And if we write a constructor with arguments or no-arguments then the compiler does not create a default constructor.
Default constructor provides the default values to the object like 0, null, etc. depending on the type.
  
  Parameterized Constructor:
   A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor. If we want to initialize fields of the class with your own values, then use a parameterized constructor.

4) The three properties of an object are:
    State: represents the data (value) of an object.
    Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
    Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.
